# credit-risk-classification
 Module 20- Supervised Learning Challenge

In this Challenge, various techniques are used to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. A dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company was used to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

## Description
The code transforms the data into logistic regression models to find and predict the percentages of unhealthy and healthy loans and the success rate of the predictions using the sklearn.metrics library. A data analysis of the information found is used to find the most relieble k-value to seperate the cluster sets and find trends.
